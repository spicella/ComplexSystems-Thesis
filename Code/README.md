Notes:
  - Only if grid sizes are large enough it is possbile to have a profile for the propensity map which suggests the bistability: this means that to investigate the given phenomena, an *appropriate* grid size is needed

  ...this is why, when simulating with smaller grid, parameters must be scaled accordingly
  - *Python* : "With great modules comes great responsibility."
  - *JULIA* re-structure the code in the *Julia* way..
