# Complex Systems Thesis 

![alt text](https://github.com/spicella/ComplexSystems-Thesis/blob/master/full.png)
*From "The Strategy of the Genes"* - Waddington, 1957
## Summary
  As a final step for the **Complex Systems** profile in the MSc in Experimental Physics at Utrecht University, we are required to work on a 15EC project. This project must have two supervisors from two different departments (other from physics). This repo in particular is meant to keep track of evolution of the project over time, to collect bibliography, notes, ideas and issues.

## Outline of the project
  Coming soon!
### Main steps
  Coming soon!
#### How to use the repo: 
- Bibliography:
  - Collection of useful paper and references to take inspiration from, both directly linked to the topic and additional material regarding possible outlines
- Code:
  - "bistable_switch" replicates Kryven et al. "Solution of the chemical master equation by radial basis functions approximation with interface tracking" for bistable switch case. Comments in the python codes are self explanatory. Note that no "for" loop was used to improve time performances.
  - Julia version of the code is meant to replicate results from .py but in a way faster way.
  - Folders with results data/outputs will automatically created/updated when running the codes [PY].
- Results: 
  - Will be presented withi each folder for the correspondent simulation parameters.

  
#### Ideas:
  - Relate evolution of the systems to propensities maps
  - Implement edge detection and keep track of support displacements for given values of PDF ratio over total PDF
  - Multithread! [In progress]
  
#### Issues:
  - Not still able to reproduce splitting in bistability from paper..!
