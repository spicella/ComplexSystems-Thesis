- Visualization caveat: even though the maximum in the colorbar decreases below the unit, still sum of probability over the grid stays almost constant and redistributes over the grid (just a little drift over t). Only when the BC of the grid are reached there is a significant drop in the global probability.
- For grid size < 300 parameters, coefficients for the dynamical systems scaled with respect to the one used  have been chose to match the case from the "*Solution of the chemical master equation by radial basis functions approximation with interface tracking*" paper (first case of "Bistable toggle switch") should have been used.
