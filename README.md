*From "The Strategy of the Genes"* - Waddington, 1957
## Summary
  As a final step for the **Complex Systems** profile in the MSc in Experimental Physics at Utrecht University, we are required to work on a 15EC project. This project must have two supervisors from two different departments (other from physics). This repo in particular is meant to keep track of evolution of the project over time, to collect bibliography, notes, ideas and issues.

## Outline of the project
  Coming soon!
### Main steps
  Coming soon!
#### How to use the repo: 
- Bibliography:
  - Collection of useful paper and references to take inspiration from, both directly linked to the topic and additional material regarding possible outlines
- Code:
  - Julia version of the code is meant to replicate results from .py but in a way faster way.
  - Folders with results data/outputs will automatically created/updated when running the codes.
- Results: 
  - Will be presented within each folder for the correspondent simulation parameters.

#### Ideas:
  - Efficient multithread! [In progress]
  
#### Issues:
